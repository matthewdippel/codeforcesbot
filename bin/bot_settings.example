To set up this file properly:
    i) Copy to a new file, with a name and location of your choosing (we will pipe it into the cfbot call when we initialize the bot)
    ii) Replace the string EXAMPLE_CHANNEL with your desired channel, and EXAMPLE_TOKEN with your bot token
    iii) Remove all text between the *** lines
    iv) If your file location is fpath, call the bot with the following command line:
        cat fpath | xargs cfbot
